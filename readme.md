# Facial Recognition Attendance System

A full-stack mobile application that uses facial recognition for user registration and authentication. This project is built with a React Native (Expo) frontend, a Python (FastAPI) backend, and the `DeepFace` library.

## 🚀 Project Overview & Architecture

This section explains the features and technical design of the project.

### Features

* **User Registration:** Register a new user with their name, email, and a photo.
* **Dual Image Input:** Supports capturing a live photo with the camera or uploading from the phone's gallery.
* **User Authentication:** Log in an existing user by verifying their face.
* **Efficient AI Matching:** The system pre-calculates a user's "face fingerprint" (embedding) once during registration and stores it in the database for fast, scalable matching.

  ### 1. Registration Flow
  1.  A user fills out their name/email and uploads a photo on the React Native app.
  2.  The app sends this data to the `POST /register` endpoint on the FastAPI server.
  3.  The server saves the user's name/email to the `users.db` (SQLite) database.
  4.  The server uses `DeepFace.represent()` to generate a **face embedding** (a "math fingerprint").
  5.  This embedding is saved in the database next to the user's name.

  ### 2. Login (Recognition) Flow
  1.  A user takes or selects a new photo on the app.
  2.  The app sends this photo to the `POST /recognize` endpoint.
  3.  The server generates a new embedding for this temporary photo.
  4.  The server loops through all embeddings in the database, using `numpy` to find the one with the lowest "distance" (highest similarity).
  5.  If a match is found, the server returns the matched user's name. Otherwise, it returns a "Not Found" error.

  This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook, `model_showcase.ipynb`, that provides a deep dive into the AI model. It visually demonstrates:
  1.  How an image is converted into an embedding.
  2.  How the "distance" score is calculated for a "match" vs. a "rejection".

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

This section explains how to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Conda (or another Python environment manager)
* Node.js (LTS version)
* The **Expo Go** app on your physical phone (iOS or Android)
* A free `ngrok` account (for the authtoken)

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git)
cd your-project/backend

# 2. Create and activate the Conda environment
conda create -n face-api-env python=3.11
conda activate face-api-env

# 3. Install all Python packages
pip install "fastapi[all]" sqlalchemy deepface numpy matplotlib ipykernel
